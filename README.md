# Bond-Energy-Algorithm_Distributed-Databases
Python implementation of Bond Energy Algorithm using the example from Principles of Distributed Database Systems 3e (Page 100- 107)

I was going to implement this myself, but it turns out someone else with the same textbook already did it (seriously, is there only one textbook and one set of lecture slides for everyone?). 

So, I made the output prettier, made it generalizable to nxn matrices, added the row adjustment step so you get the attribute clustering, and added the partitioning algorithm shown in the textbook. Why? Because I felt like it.

Presented as a Python script or a Jupyter notebook if you prefer. Requires numpy.
